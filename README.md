# TMDBApp

This is my project test for Arctouch. 

These are the third-party libraries that I used in this project

1. Alamofire,
to make request from API

2. AlamofireImage,
to get images from server

3. SVProgressHUD,
to show a progress while the data is loading


I used appicon.build to create the icons for this app
